# localhost/woow-headscale:<headscale version>-r<package revision>
#
# Built by scripts/install.sh and scripts/upgrade.sh; there is no registry image for it
# (decision D3 - publishing to GHCR is future work, see README "Image and versions").
# Bump the tag in quadlet/headscale.container and HEADSCALE_IMAGE in scripts/common.sh
# together, then run scripts/upgrade.sh.
#
# Why a build at all, when upstream publishes a perfectly good image: the upstream image is
# built with ko and contains the headscale binary and nothing else - no shell, no coreutils.
# A Quadlet HealthCmd= becomes `podman run --health-cmd`, and podman runs a non-JSON value
# through /bin/sh, so the health check could not run there. Adding a Debian base keeps the
# unmodified upstream binary and gives the health check a shell to live in.
#
# Both bases are pinned by digest, so a rebuild on another host produces the same runtime.
